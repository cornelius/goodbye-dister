      <p>Dister, the SUSE Studio mascot, has served you well. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUSE_Studio">SUSE Studio</a> did <b>3.7 million builds</b> for more than <b>800 thousand users</b>. Now it's time to say goodbye. Dister is retiring. SUSE Studio has been shut down.</p>
      
      <p><em>We have powerful alternatives for you:</em></p>
      
      <p><a href="https://github.com/SUSE/kiwi">Kiwi</a> has been the core of SUSE Studio from the beginning. It's SUSE's command line image building tool. There you have full control. Use it to build your virtual machine and cloud images. It also does containers and installation images.</p>
      
      <p>If you prefer a service to build your images, the <a href="https://build.opensuse.org">Open Build Service</a> is there for you. You get the full power of Kiwi plus automatic rebuilds on change of dependencies. This is your solution for continuous integration and delivery.</p>

      <p>Going public cloud? SUSE's images are already there. Choose a <a href="https://www.suse.com/promo/cloud/public/">SLES image</a> for certifications and support. Or go with <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Cloud">openSUSE</a> for community and development.<p>
      
      <p>If you moved to containers, Dister recommends to use the official <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/opensuse/">openSUSE container images</a>. They are a wonderful base for your container workloads.</p>

      <p><em>Thanks for your support for all the years. We'll see you on the other side.</em></p>
